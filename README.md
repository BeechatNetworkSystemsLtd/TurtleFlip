## What is TurtleFlip?

TurtleFlip is an adversarial machine learning project meant to provide privacy to users of social media from the platforms' content surveillance. This will enable true freedom of speech by protecting users from shadowbanning, restricted accounts, and other forms of unjust censorship.

## Why?
Tech corporations have reached an unprecedented level of power. Censorship & surveillance are affecting every aspect of society. Some have tried to create their own platforms, but censorship has affected them too (shutting down of servers, deletion from app stores, blocking of payment services). While [Beechat](https://github.com/BeechatNetworkSystemsLtd/BeechatNetwork) serves to provide a true decentralized platform, TurtleFlip aims to enable users to continue using the mainstream social media platforms without being censored by machine learning algorithms.

## Applications
- Creating content that will not be shadowbanned.
- Preventing social media accounts from being deleted from sharing "fact-checked" content.

## Why not use an alternative (.ie Gab) as opposed to the mainstream option (.ie Twitter)?
As mentioned, alternative platforms are still not fully decentralized, and can be monitored and censored in several ways. While Beechat will address those problems by providing a true decentralized platform, the fact remains that currently, most Internet users are found on Facebook and Twitter. **TurtleFlip** will help ensure that the content aimed at users of these mainstream platforms will not be censored.

## Current status

 * Researching machine learning algorithms 
 * Testing efficiency of different distortion methods

## Next Steps
* Developing user-friendly app
* Testing efficiency on mainstream platforms
